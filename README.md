# Natural Asset Smart Contract

## Summary
A standard for creating and managing natural asset-backed smart contracts using ERC-1155 tokens to represent and track natural capital, incorporating environmental data and enabling markets for ecosystem service commodities.

## Abstract
This project, developed for ETH Global's HackFS 2024, is based in the creation of a new standard for Natural Asset Smart Contracts using ERC-1155 tokens to represent natural assets and their associated ecosystem services.  The standard includes mechanisms for recording historical cummulative effects, baseline data, funding, work being executed for restoration or conservation, and time-series data to monitor the changes in the ecosystem.  NASCs are categorized into 4 types: Project-Based, Municipal, Basin, and Nation State.

## Motivation
Natural capital is the substrate that provide the means for life, it is the set of renewable and non-renewable resources that comprise an ecosystem, elements like water, soil, minerals, flora and fauna are the true metrics to measure the wealth of nations.

Extinction and loss of these critical ecosystems is diminishing and an outstanding rate, and the lack of standardized mechanisms to represent, track, and trade these assets hinders the efficient allocation of capital towards their preservation and restoration. This standard aims to create a transparent, equitable, and efficient market for natural assets, encouraging investment in nature-based solutions. Differentiating NASCs by territory scope and enabling hierarchical references ensures appropriate management and valuation for varying scales of natural assets. Additionally, integrating AI oracles allows for real-time data analysis and automatic issuance of ecosystem service commodities, increasing efficiency and accuracy.

# Functional Specifications

## Overview
Natural Asset Smart Contracts are an extension of the ERC-1155 Multi-token standard, that are designed to provide a comprehensive digital record of natural assets, including the territory's location, dimensions, cumulative effects studies, baseline data, regeneration/conservation projects, monitoring data and a registry of the environmental commodities emitted.
